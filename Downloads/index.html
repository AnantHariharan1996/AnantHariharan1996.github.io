						<h2> 1) Measurements illustrating Rayleigh-wave major arc overtone interference. </h2>
Theoretically, major-arc overtone interference can be detected clearly on amplitude and interstation phase velocity measurements at epicentral distances greater than 120 degrees. 
To provide an example of it in synthertic seismograms, I have generated seismograms along an entire great circle path, as we do in Hariharan et al., 2020 and Hariharan et al., 2021.
			The attached set of phase and amplitude measurements, made on synthetic seismograms generated using mode summation through a
1-D Earth model, and on stations along a great-circle path, illustrates the phenomenon of major-arc overtone interference.
The period used is 100s. Columns are: event lat, event lon, station lat, station lon, phase, diag sum, amplitude. <a href="ALLMODE_dtpamp_100s_201502131859" download> Download File Here </a>

Major-arc overtone interference, as described in our 2020 and 2021 papers, can clearly be seen by simply plotting the measured surface-wave amplitudes as a function of epicentral distance.
