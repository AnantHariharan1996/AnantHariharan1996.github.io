						<h2> Love Wave Phase Velocity Maps of the United States </h2>
We have calculated Love Wave phase Velocity maps of the Continental United States at periods between 35-75 s. These are the first Love wave phase velocity maps from Earthquakes that span the entirety of USArray. They constrain structure within the lithosphere and uppermost asthenosphere. These results are described in Hariharan & Dalton, 2022.

									<h2> Radially Anisotropic Shear-Wave Velocity Model of the United States  </h2>

Using an up-to-date database of Rayleigh and Love wave Phase Velocity maps, we developed a 3D model of radial anisotropy, a quantity that shows how seismic wave speeds vary as a function of direction. Our images constrain structure within the lithosphere and uppermost asthenosphere. These results are described in Hariharan & Dalton, 2025.
