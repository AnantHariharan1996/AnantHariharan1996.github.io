      <h3> Accounting for Focusing and Defocusing effects in Surface-Wave Attenuation</h3>
      <p> Measurements of attenuation are essential to uniquely interpret the thermal structure and composition of the Earth's mantle.
However, robust surface-wave measurements of attenuation are limited by the effects of focusing and defocusing on the wavefield, which
has so far made implementing accurate corrections to measurements of phase and amplitude difficult. We use Spectral-Element simulations of wave
propagation through a synthetic tomographic model with high-resolution regional velocity heterogeneity and no intrinsic attenuation
to isolate the effects on attenuation measurements from velocity anomalies.

     <h3> Spatiospectral Localization of Mantle Structure using Wavelets</h3>
      <p> Our inferences of the properties of Earth structure are guided by tomographic models of Earth structure.Reconciling global and regional tomographic models is necessary to generate accurate simulations. 
This work is done in a collaboration with the Seismology Group at the University of Maryland, and began as part of an IRIS Internship.

      <h3> Crustal and Upper Mantle Structure on the Flanks of the Main Ethiopian RIft</h3>
      <p> This study leverages a deployment of broadband seismic stations on the flanks of the Main Ethiopian Rift to probe the nature of 
crustal and upper mantle structure. Understanding the nature of deformation over a vast area 
beneath and surrounding the Main Ethiopian Rift allows us to better inform models of 
continental rifting, as well as the transition from continental rifting to oceanic spreading. We use a gauntlet of passive seismic
			methods to understand the properties of the crust and upper mantle in this region. We constrain deformation from the Main Ethiopian Rift and 
identify a laterally migrating mantle upwelling impinging on the lithosphere beneath the Ethiopian Plateau, 
that results in both magmatic underplating, quaternary volcanism, and the presence of melt in the crust, as indicated by both Vp/Vs
ratios and diagnostic patterns of anisotropy. <br>

			<h3>The Properties of Hydrous Mineral Phases at Depth</h3>
      <p> Understanding the properties of hydrated mineral phases at depth can yield powerful insight into the bulk properties of Earth structure
in geodynamically complex settings such as the hydrated layers overlying subducting slabs. Using first-principle <i> ab initio </i> simulations of crystal
structure allows us to model the equations of state, detailed crystal structure, and elasticity of these phases. The latter observation also allows us to understand
	      the anisotropy of these phases. Results from these studies were published in <i>Nature</i> and <i> Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors</i>. I was supervised by Professor Mainak Mookherjee during the course of this work. </p>
