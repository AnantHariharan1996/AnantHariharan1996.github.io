      <h3> The Origin of Focusing and Defocusing effects</h3>
      <p> Measurements of attenuation are essential to uniquely interpret the thermal structure and composition of the Earth's mantle.
However, robust surface-wave measurements of attenuation are limited by the effects of focusing and defocusing on the wavefield, which
has so far made implementing accurate corrections to measurements of phase and amplitude difficult. We use Spectral-Element simulations of wave
propagation through a synthetic tomographic model with high-resolution regional velocity heterogeneity and no intrinsic attenuation
to isolate the effects on attenuation measurements from velocity anomalies. </p>
