      <h3> Understanding Rayleigh Wave Overtone Interference</h3>
      <p> We showed for the first time that measurements of Rayleigh wave phase and amplitude (and phase velocity) are affected by interference from major-arc overtones- the interference is best seen at epicentral distances greater than 120 degrees.
	      Empirical proof of the phenomenon, through analysis of measurements made on spectral-element simulations and real data recorded by USArray, is shown <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JB018540?af=R"> here. </a>
	      Further exploration of this phenomenon is underway, with the goal of better understanding the origin of aspects of the interference pattern
	      and the extent to which different factors effect it.

      <h3> Accounting for Focusing and Defocusing effects in Surface-Wave Attenuation</h3>
      <p> Measurements of attenuation are essential to uniquely interpret the thermal structure and composition of the Earth's mantle.
However, robust surface-wave measurements of attenuation are limited by the effects of focusing and defocusing on the wavefield, which
has so far made implementing accurate corrections to measurements of phase and amplitude difficult. We use Spectral-Element simulations of wave
propagation through a synthetic tomographic model with high-resolution regional velocity heterogeneity and no intrinsic attenuation
to isolate the effects on attenuation measurements from velocity anomalies.

     <h3> Spatiospectral Localization of Mantle Structure using Wavelets</h3>
      <p> Our inferences of the properties of Earth structure are guided by tomographic models of Earth structure. Reconciling global and regional tomographic models is necessary to 
	  understand the spectra of the Earth's heterogeneity across scales and constrain geodynamic processes across vast length and timescales. This reconciliation has previously been impeded
by the different basis functions one must use to decompose global and regional models, which impede a true comparison. Comparison via the simple truncation of a global model is equivalent to convolution with 
a boxcar function, resulting in oscillations when expanded into the wavenumber domain. To avert this, we use wavelets to spatiospectrally localize regional and global models, 
allowing for a true and formal comparison. This expands our ability to analyse mantle heterogeneity, allowing us to develop spatially-varying maps of agreement between global models, 
chimeric models taking advantage of the best-constrained spectral ranges from global and regional models, and a full comparison of model correlation and RMS over select geographical regions such as the Continental US, which takes advantage of the 
impressive resolution offered by recent seismic deployments.  
<br>
Codes to enable anyone to analyse a range of tomographic models using this framework within the Python environment will soon be released to the public.

			<h3>The Properties of Hydrous Mineral Phases at Depth</h3>
      <p> Understanding the properties of hydrated mineral phases at depth can yield powerful insight into the bulk properties of Earth structure
in geodynamically complex settings such as the hydrated layers overlying subducting slabs. Using first-principle <i> ab initio </i> simulations of crystal
structure allows us to model the equations of state, detailed crystal structure, and elasticity of these phases. The latter observation also allows us to understand
	      the anisotropy of these phases. Results from these studies were published in <i>Nature</i> and <i> Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors</i>. I was supervised by Professor Mainak Mookherjee during the course of this work. </p>
