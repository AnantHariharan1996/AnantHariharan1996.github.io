			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Born in the US, I  grew up in several locations. In 2018, I graduated <i>Summa Cum Laude</i> from Cornell University, with majors in Geological Sciences and Physics.
During my undergraduate years, I emphasized collaboration with Geophysics groups both at and outside Cornell, and explored aspects of both regional passive and global seismology. 
In particular, I've studied the crustal and upper mantle structure of the Flanks of the Main Ethiopian Rift, and worked with the application of wavelets to the problem of spatio-spectral localization of mantle structure.
I've also worked in the field of high-pressure mineral physics and with a Project Team at Cornell designing a building to withstand ground motion. </p>
<p> Outside seismology and geophysics, I enjoy novels, playing on my guitar, and swimming. </p>
