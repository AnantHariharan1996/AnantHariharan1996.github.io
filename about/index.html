			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics within the University of California San Diego. I graduated with a PhD from Brown University in 2023.
My research centers on improving our understanding of how the Earth’s interior deforms and evolves by developing high-resolution observational constraints on the state of the Earth's interior. I do so using seismic data, and a recurring motif in my work is the exploration of new approaches to improve the quality of the raw and processed data used in seismic images as well as the algorithms used to generate images of the Earth's interior. My imaging targets have spanned the upper crust to the lower mantle, and geographic regions including the Southwest Pacific Ocean, Hawai'i, Greenland, Ethiopia, and the Continental U.S. I have drawn upon observables of the seismic wavefield
spanning three orders of magnitude in period.

My PhD studies focused on the robustness of Rayleigh and Love wave measurements in the presence of interference from
overtones and the consequent development of Love wave phase maps and a 3-D radially anisotropic model spanning the entirety of the continental U.S.
