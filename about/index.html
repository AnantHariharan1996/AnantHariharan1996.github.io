			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I am currently a Graduate student at Brown University, in the Geophysics group. I graduated with a PhD from Brown University in 2023 and graduated <i>Summa Cum Laude</i> with a Bachelor's of Arts from Cornell University in 2018 with majors in Geological Sciences and Physics.
My research focuses on improving our understanding of Earth structure across multiple scales- I strive to improve the quality of the raw and processed data used in seismic images as well as the robustness
of the algorithms used to generate images of the Earth's interior. My imaging targets have spanned the upper crust to the lower mantle, and geographic regions including Greenland, Ethiopia, and the Continental U.S. I have drawn upon observables of the seismic wavefield
spanning three orders of magnitude in period.

My PhD studies focused on the robustness of Rayleigh and Love wave measurements in the presence of interference from
overtones and the consequent development of Love wave phase maps and a 3-D radially anisotropic model spanning the entirety of the continental U.S. 
For more information about my dissertation results, feel free to check out  this <a href="https://graduateschool.brown.edu/news/2023-05-25/joukowsky-2023-hariharan">article</a> by Brown University.			</p>
<p> Outside seismology and geophysics, I enjoy novels, twanging away on my guitar, and swimming. </p>
